🎓 Student Performance Prediction (ML Project)
📌 Overview

This project is a complete end-to-end Machine Learning pipeline that predicts a student’s math score based on demographic and academic features.

It includes:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Data preprocessing pipeline
Multiple regression models
Model comparison & evaluation
Modular production-ready code (src/ pipeline)
📊 Problem Statement

The goal is to predict:

➡️ math_score

using features like:

Gender
Race/Ethnicity
Parental level of education
Lunch type
Test preparation course
Reading score
Writing score
🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

The EDA notebook (EDA.ipynb) focuses on:

Key Insights:
📈 Reading & writing scores strongly correlate with math score
🍽️ Students with standard lunch perform better
🎓 Completing test preparation course improves scores
👨‍👩‍👧 Parental education has a moderate impact
⚖️ Gender differences exist but are not dominant
Visualizations Included:
Distribution plots
Correlation heatmap
Box plots for categorical variables
Pairplots for feature relationships
⚙️ Project Architecture

The project follows a modular ML pipeline structure:
